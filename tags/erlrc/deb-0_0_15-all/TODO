- application still shows up in loaded_applications even after removing
  package and showing message "erlrc-stop: ... unloaded"
- ensure no dangling code references after failed upgrade (must reload old
  version modules)
- release handler can leave code path fucked if upgrade fails?

- don't allow override of module or version portions of app spec ... would cause havoc with appup computation

I'm in ur Erlang upgrading ur applicationz
