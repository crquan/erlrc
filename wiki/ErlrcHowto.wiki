#summary An explanation of erlrc

= Introduction =

One of Erlang's strengths is hot code loading, the ability to change the software on the system without interrupting service.  For internet applications this is especially powerful.

Hot code loading in Erlang consists of low-level language support, and a high-level strategy of [http://linux.die.net/man/3/release_handler release handling] embodied in the OTP libraries.

erlrc embodies another high level strategy for using the low-level capabilities of Erlang for hot code loading.  Unlike release handling it is designed to be incremental and integrated into the OS package management.  The goal are experiences like this:

Basically, on the running Erlang node on my machine, the Erlang application egerl was hot-code upgraded from 4.0.1 to 4.1.0 when the package was installed.  If this were an initial install, it would have started the application instead.
