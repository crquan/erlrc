= Introduction =

Do NOT attempt to build from a checkout from the source code repository: that is for wizards only. Instead, grab one of the released source tarballs from the [http://code.google.com/p/erlrc/downloads/list downloads] tab.

This page will assist you in installing erlrc.[[#2 2]]

Prerequisites:
  1. gnu make
  1. working erlang installation.
     * debian: aptitude install erlang-dev
     * os/x (with [http://www.finkproject.org/ fink]): apt-get install erlang-otp
     * freebsd: pkg_add -r erlang
     * others: ???
  1. [http://support.process-one.net/doc/display/CONTRIBS/EUnit eunit] from process one; optional but 'make check' will not do anything without it.

Go to the [http://code.google.com/p/erlrc/downloads/list?can=2&q=*.tar.gz&colspec=Filename+Summary+Uploaded+Size+DownloadCount downloads section] and grab the latest {{{.tar.gz}}} file.


{{{
# tar -zxf erlrc-0.1.14.tar.gz
# cd erlrc-0.1.14
# ./configure --prefix /usr/local && make && make -s check
...
}}}
The default prefix is {{{/usr}}} so if you are ok with that you can omit the prefix argument.  Hopefully what you see[[#1 1]] is something like

If not, the test output for {{{test-FOO}}} is in {{{tests/test-FOO.out}}}; perhaps it is informative.

Now you can {{{make install}}}.

== 1 ==
If you see something like:
{{{
fw requires GNU make to build, you are using bsd make
*** Error code 1

Stop.
}}}
Then you are using bsd make which will not work.  Try again with gnu make, e.g.,
{{{
# ./configure --prefix=/usr/local && gmake -s check
}}}

== 2 ==

Downloadable source tarballs use automake to build. A source code checkout of the repository uses [http://code.google.com/p/framewerk fwtemplates] to build, and if you don't know what that is, you probably want to stick with the tarballs.
